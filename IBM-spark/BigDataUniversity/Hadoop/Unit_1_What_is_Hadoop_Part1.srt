Hello everyone and welcome to Hadoop Fundamentals What is Hadoop. My name is Asma Desai

1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,400
and I will be covering this topic.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,910
In this video we will explain what is Hadoop and what is Big Data. We will define some

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,100
Hadoop-related open source projects and give some examples of Hadoop in action. Finally

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,750
we will end off with some Big Data solutions and the Cloud.

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,450
Imagine this scenario: You have 1GB of data that you need to process.

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,570
The data is stored in a relational database in your desktop computer which has no problem

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,350
handling the load

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,750
Then your company starts growing very quickly, and that data grows to 10GB,

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,310
then 100GB,

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,500
And you start to reach the limits of your current desktop computer.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,030
so what do you do? you scale up by investing in a larger computer, and you are then OK

12
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,320
for a few more months

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,350
When your data grows from 1 TB to 10TB, and then 100TB,

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,489
you are again quickly approaching the limits of that computer.

15
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:09,170
Moreover, you are now asked to feed your application with unstructured data coming from sources

16
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,780
like Facebook, Twitter, RFID readers, sensors, and so on.

17
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,770
Your management wants to derive information from both the relational data and the unstructured

18
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,529
data and wants this information as soon as possible

19
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:27,279
What should you do? Hadoop may be the answer

20
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:30,630
What is Hadoop? Hadoop is an open source project of the Apache

21
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,529
Foundation. It is a framework written in Java originally

22
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:37,529
developed by Doug Cutting who named it after his son&#39;s toy elephant.

23
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:41,109
Hadoop uses Google&#39;s MapReduce technology as its foundation.

24
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:45,529
It is optimized to handle massive quantities of data which could be structured, unstructured

25
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:51,569
or semi-structured, using commodity hardware, that is, relatively inexpensive computers.

26
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,959
This massive parallel processing is done with great performance. However, it is a batch

27
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,229
operation handling massive amounts of data, so the response time is not immediate. Currently,

28
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,529
in place updates are not possible in Hadoop, but appends to existing data is supported.

29
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:09,030
Now, what&#39;s the value of a system if the information it stores or retrieves is not

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,580
consistent? Hadoop replicates its data across different

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,370
computers, so that if one goes down, the data is processed on one of the replicated computers.

32
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,780
Hadoop is not suitable for OnLine Transaction Processing workloads where data is randomly

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,540
accessed on structured data like a relational database.

34
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,090
Also, Hadoop is not suitable for OnLine Analytical Processing or Decision Support System workloads

35
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,610
where data is sequentially accessed on structured data like a relational database, to generate

36
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,500
reports that provide business intelligence. As of Hadoop version 2.6, updates are not

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,610
possible, but appends are possible. Hadoop is used for Big Data. It complements

38
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,240
OnLine Transaction Processing and OnLine Analytical Processing.

39
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,050
It is NOT a replacement for a relational database system.

40
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,080
So, what is Big Data? With all the devices available today to collect

41
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,820
data, such as RFID readers, microphones, cameras, sensors, and so on, we are seeing an explosion

42
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,370
in data being collected worldwide. Big Data is a term used to describe large

43
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,200
collections of data (also known as datasets) that may be unstructured, and grow so large

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,580
and quickly that it is difficult to manage with a regular database or statistical tools.

45
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,790
In terms of numbers, what are we looking at? How BIG is &quot;big data&quot;?

46
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,390
Well there are more than 3.2 billion internet users, and

47
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:28,470
Active cell phones have surpassed 7.6 billion. There are now more in-use cell phones than

48
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,380
there are people on the planet (7.4 billion).

49
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,110
Twitter processes 7TB of data ever day,

50
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,200
and 600TB of data is processed by Facebook every day.

51
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,490
Interestingly, about 80% of this data is unstructured.

52
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,650
With this massive amount of data, businesses need fast, reliable, deeper data insight.

53
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,340
Therefore, Big Data solutions based on Hadoop and other analytics software are becoming

54
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
more and more relevant

55
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
This lesson continues in the next video
